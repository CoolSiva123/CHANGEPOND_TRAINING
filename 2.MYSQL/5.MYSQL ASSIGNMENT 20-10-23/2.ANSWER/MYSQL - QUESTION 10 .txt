--10.1 Join table PEOPLE and ADDRESS, but keep only one address information for each person (we don't mind which record we take for each person). 
       i.e., the joined table should have the same number of rows as table PEOPLE

  ANS: SELECT P.ID,P.NAME,A.ADDRESS,A.UPDATEDATE
       FROM PEOPLE P,ADDRESS A 
       WHERE P.ID=A.ID AND UPDATEDATE IN (SELECT MIN(UPDATEDATE) FROM ADDRESS GROUP BY ID);




--10.2 Join table PEOPLE and ADDRESS, but ONLY keep the LATEST address information for each person. 
       i.e., the joined table should have the same number of rows as table PEOPLE


   ANS: SELECT P.ID,P.NAME,A.ADDRESS,A.UPDATEDATE
       FROM PEOPLE P,ADDRESS A 
       WHERE P.ID=A.ID AND UPDATEDATE IN (SELECT MAX(UPDATEDATE) FROM ADDRESS GROUP BY ID);
